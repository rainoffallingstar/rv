Generate User-Facing Release Notes
You will be provided with several context files to help you create release notes
that focus exclusively on changes that impact end users. Your goal is to communicate
what's new, changed, or fixed from the user's perspective, ignoring internal implementation details.
Input Files You'll Receive:

README.md and other documentation files
Architecture notes (claude.md, etc.)
Git diffs showing code changes
Full contents of modified files
Previous release notes for style/format reference

Instructions:

Focus on User Impact Only

Include only changes that users will notice or that affect their experience
Ignore internal refactoring, code cleanup, dependency updates, or implementation changes
Ask yourself: "Will the user see, feel, or experience this change?" If no, exclude it


Categorize Changes

New Features: Capabilities users didn't have before
Improvements: Enhancements to existing functionality
Bug Fixes: Issues users encountered that are now resolved
Breaking Changes: Changes requiring users to modify their usage
Deprecations: Features being phased out with migration guidance


Writing Style

Use clear, non-technical language
Write in present tense ("The app now supports..." not "Added support for...")
Be specific about benefits ("Upload files up to 100MB" not "Increased file size limit")
Keep each item concise (1-2 sentences max)
Use active voice


Examples of What to Include:

✅ ability to configure repositories programmatically via rv configure repository
✅ fixed issue where rv could not remove a library on an NFS file system


Examples of What to Exclude:

❌ "Refactored http connection pooling"
❌ "Updated library from v17 to v18"
❌ "Improved code coverage to 85%"

Format Requirements

Start with a brief summary (2-3 sentences) highlighting the most important changes
Group items by category
Use bullet points for individual changes
Include version number and release date
Add migration notes for breaking changes



Output Format:
## vX.Y.Z - [Date]

[Brief summary of major highlights]

### 🎉 New Features
- [Feature description focusing on user benefit]

### ⚡ Improvements
- [Enhancement description with specific user impact]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- [Fixed issue description from user perspective]

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- [Change description with migration instructions]


When considering the different output types, bug fixes should be described in terms of what they fix.

a real world example:

### ⚡ Improvements
- **Improved installation logging**: Install logs are now saved during the build process rather than at the end, providing better debugging capabilities for failed installations.
- **Enhanced force_source handling**: When `force_source` is enabled, rv now properly ignores cached binary packages that weren't built from source by rv itself, ensuring packages are compiled locally as requested.
- **Better error handling**: Enhanced error messages for invalid packages with clearer path and error information.
- **Improved R command detection**: Better handling of R.bat detection on Windows systems and more reliable R version finding across platforms.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed library comparison logic**: Resolved issues where builtin packages weren't properly recognized as installed in project summaries.
- **Fixed database loading**: Added fallback mechanism when loading cached package databases fails, ensuring rv can recover by re-fetching the data.

Note that better error handling and improved r cmd detection are improvements. In previous attempts you have classified these as bug fixes.
Bug fixes are all noted as Fixed...

another example, of an improvment, not a bug fix: - **Fixed git repository error handling**: Improved error messages when DESCRIPTION files are not found in git repositories, providing clearer feedback when package metadata is missing.

after creating a potential message CAREFULLY REVIEW the messaging to determine its type, particularly improvements or adjustments to make user experience better vs true bug fixes

Review the git diffs and file changes, but translate technical changes into user benefits.
If a diff shows performance optimizations, describe how the app is now faster.
If it shows new API endpoints, describe what new actions users can perform.

Err on the side of uncertainty, if you're unsure of what a feature does or how it impacts a user,
NOTE IT AS A TODO FOR REVIEW as these release notes will be reviewed by a human before final publication.

USE THE STYLE OF THE CHANGELOG.md FILE AS A GUIDE FOR FORMAT AND TONE. REVIEW ITS CONTENT CAREFULLY
DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OR TECHNICAL JARGON.
